To use the code from any branch from this github as if it were installed locally; you can copy and use the "github_import" function to load it, and use the "exec" python statement to use and link it into the runtime. It should put "Pip" or "poetry" out of the equation for package {install and run} builds. Just write and load once, and publish the update under a new branch. Come on man, make it easier for the developers.

This also is useful for the python built "kernel" and "kernel" functions that work with a web-linked copy of unicorn-engine.
Due note that it is possible to import local to your runtime and override or patch a broken function locally, even in your browser with "brython.js" inside the browser.

As I update this repository, the master branch will be updated with a change log; the next update will include what changed.

https://unicorn-scaled-and-scanned-the-globe.dylaneliot.repl.run/ is an example showing it install a package and them running my code from the branch I was testing with, and continue to test with.
