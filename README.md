Welcome.

This is a c/c++ emulator that comes with a linux kernel. The only requirement are {bootable OS, a copy of python installed, and a compiled version of unicorn-engine}.
This lets you use c/c++ types, functions and a python based linux kernel, all of which interfaces with unicorn-engine, which interfaces with python.
